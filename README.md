Title: Eye Exercise

Description: This project utilizes the on mouse move javascript feature to update the inner ball of the eyes to follow the mouse movement.

How to run: Open the html file by going to https://jmobarry.github.io/eyes/ and move mouse around to interact with moving eyes.

Roadmap for future improvements: In the future I will attempt to add a mouth that is closed and when clicked on will open into a smile.
